# Hello Once Again
Welcome to my ~~third~~, first iteration of hyang.xyz. Now that my hosting stuff is stable again, I hope that I can finally stop messing around with Linux and start doing things that I can look back on years later. And what better way to do that than start writing blog posting? 

(I also need an excuse to get better at writing...)

Also, this theme looks sick. Hopefully I won't get copystriked by GitHub :).

# The Setup
My adventures with hosting things on the online has been quite a wild ride for me. Until now, it has mostly been more of a learning experience thing. I had mostly focused on hosting stuff like Searx, Nitter, and Fediverse instances, with it lasting two weeks at most, before I get bored and just nuke it all. I also distro-hopped a lot, from Debian → Arch → OpenBSD → FreeBSD → NixOS. 

Now that I have gotten old, I now want things to just work! 

So, I've decided to start over again. This time, I had to devise a set of goals that made operating this mess as "comfy" as possible. I settled on the following:
- Sane, easy to use backups
- No Cloudflare, (various reasons: mostly just want to host other stuff like email)
- It had to be affordable (am broke)
- Make deploying stuff repetitive, and easy to maintain
